# CI/CD Pipelines Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive explanation of the GitHub Actions Workflows (or simply pipelines) 
implemented and used in my projects. These pipelines automate critical aspects of the development workflow, including
testing, code quality checks, and deployment processes.

**Remarque :** *Les explications détaillées sont disponibles en anglais et en français.*\
**Note:** *Detailed explanations are available in both English and French.*

## Purpose

The pipelines described in this documentation serve several key objectives:

- **Automation**: Reduce manual intervention by automating repetitive tasks such as testing and deployment
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure code quality and compatibility across different environments before merging changes
- **Continuous Integration**: Validate every code change automatically to catch issues early in the development cycle
- **Consistency**: Maintain standardized processes across all branches and contributions
- **Reliability**: Provide fast feedback to developers about the status of their changes

## Pipeline Overview

The following pipelines are documented in this repository:

1. **Python CI - Tests** \[[Français](python/tests.fr.md)]\[[English](python/tests.en.md)]: Automated testing across
   multiple Python versions to ensure compatibility and code quality
2. **Python CI - Coverage** : 

*(Additional pipelines will be documented as they are added)*

## How to Use This Documentation

Each pipeline is documented with:
- An overview of its purpose
- Trigger conditions (when it runs)
- Detailed step-by-step explanations of each action
- Expected outcomes and results
