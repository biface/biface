## Hi there 👋

Chief Information Officer (CIO) at one of France’s leading universities, with international professional experience and active involvement in European higher education and research networks.

Passionate about amateur development and contributing to open-source projects for the joy of creating, improving, and giving visibility to overlooked tools.

This space is where I occasionally share **personal reflections** on software development, IT governance, and professional experiences—always behind the comfort of a pseudonym.
